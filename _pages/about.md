I am interested in how the brain represents **semantic information** - the store of general knowledge that enables us to comprehend and produce language, identify and use objects, and understand and participate in events that involve us. 

During my PhD at the [MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit](https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/), I investigated the best way to study semantic representations in the brain. How should we **think** about them? How can we **measure** them? What sorts of machine learning techniques can **reveal** them in neural recordings?

In my postdoctoral work I plan to investigate the roles that the **sensory systems** play in representing semantic information. 

To answer these questions, I collaborate with scientists all over the world, including [Matt Lambon Ralph](https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.lambon-ralph/) and [Ajay Halai](https://www.halaiaphasialab.com/) in Cambridge, [Tim Rogers](http://concepts.psych.wisc.edu/) and [Chris Cox](https://faculty.lsu.edu/chriscox/people.php) in the USA, and [Riki Matsumoto](https://www.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/news/5777) and [Akihiro Shimotake](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Akihiro-Shimotake) in Japan. 

I am also interested in **research culture** - the behaviours, values, expectations, attitudes, and norms of research communities. I founded the Working Group on Research Culture to promote a positive culture at the MRC CBU.
